# DutchDesign2019

In this complex age, we embrace ambiguity and contradiction. dutchDesign is an ongoing platform for field research, observation, and reportage. It attempts to make the naturally rich life of Dutch culture fleetingly visible while leaving a space for it to describe itself. The protagonists of dutchDesign are individuals who inhabit and define their own worlds; who habitually blur and destroy boundaries, definitions, and limitations.
