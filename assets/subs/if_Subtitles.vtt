00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm Jeremy Peasley, I'm a UX director here at Intentional Futures.

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:14.045
I’m Eric Lawrence, I'm a Creative Director here at Intentional Futures.

00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:17.468
Two-thirds of this company are research and strategists.

00:00:18.013 --> 00:00:20.182
Then, design is sort of this facilitation tool that helps

00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:22.430
access into those, those kind of strategy projects.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.319
Sort of two different nuclei, I would say — one probably more traditionally

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.221
associated with communication design, graphic design, et cetera,

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:32.365
and then another nuclei around more product design

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.141
that we've been doing more recently.

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:41.156
We had done a lot of previous work with Concur,

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:44.341
and one of the people from that Concur work was now on the board of directors at KEXP.

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:48.354
They are, they are sort of the Seattle local radio station.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.461
Because they're a nonprofit, they're all genuinely passionate about the role of

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.420
bringing music to the, the culture around them.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:59.108
It also aligned with a 10 million dollar grant,

00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:02.119
and they have that great new space over by the space needle.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:07.192
Jessica Lee, who was our strategy role on that,

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.253
and pretty much ran that project, was over there all the time.

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:13.457
And getting to talk with them in the beginning, it made me realize that

00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:16.415
they're more like curators at a contemporary art museum or something.

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:20.017
It took a ton of time to talk to all of those people.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.259
Make sure they felt heard, make sure they were heard,

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.175
so that when we start shaping that into strategic direction,

00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:28.144
they see themselves in the decision making.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.384
Understanding what their hopes and dreams are…

00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:33.384
and being able to speak that language back to them,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.327
that allows us to kind of push them a little bit.

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:39.347
It allows us to advocate for ideas that are more risky.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.122
It's the idea to rapidly iterate complex ideas,

00:01:45.213 --> 00:01:46.451
through charts, through data visualizations,

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:48.148
through just like customer journey maps

00:01:48.148 --> 00:01:51.051
and reduce thoughts to some simpler iconography things like that.

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:54.318
Like, expressing those things along the way through the process,

00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:57.216
helps you get at it quicker and summarize and synthesize really fast.

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:00.442
I get energized about that,

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:03.099
getting in a room and riffing with other creative people,

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.220
of, of that cycle of iteration.

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:08.122
Like, my best days are when I get to go in a room and do that for a few hours.

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:13.180
That choice of forum, at least for me in the technology standpoint,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.207
was really important.

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:19.023
Those are non-trivial decisions and they have consequences;

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:22.000
especially given, sort of, the ubiquity of tech.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.292
But hopefully, designers are being responsible in their choice of form,

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:29.211
and they're holding people accountable to what

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.173
the intended outcomes of what that form should be as well.
