    <h3 id=”intro”>Introduction</h3>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p>My name is <a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>Aldo</span></a>. I'm an artist. I'm based in Amsterdam. And you're here in my studio. </p>
    <h3>Pot</h3>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p>With the objects it's important, I believe, that as we will search for a character in it. And I think it always is a nice thing could be that you see something else than than I do. But I see it as my task to, to be very clear and outspoken in
      this as I do not want a conflict of characters within one object.</p>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p>Let's speak about <span id=“keyword”>Pot</span>. It's a piece I did. It's produced from bone China as that was the only way to get this very vivid, almost, a colour that you cannot touch it. It almost makes it disappear that is in line with
      the <a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>flatness</span></a> of it. </p>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p>I want my things to be at ease. Sometimes it's very clear how to make use of it, and that it functions well. Other times it doesn't. And, I believe there's a good reason for it. As long when the piece is quiet and confident, then I do not want
      to interfere anymore. That's it.</p>
    <h3>Swing</h3>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p>So what is, for me the most important is that an object becomes independent, which means that it should not just receive a seating or a backrest or whatever that we recognize as being a chair. Because that will kick you out of your dream.</p>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p><a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>Swing</span></a> is, above all, a combination of <a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>three arc shapes</span></a>, let's say. That's what it is, that's the composition. It's called swing because you can take a seat on it. You can make use of it. And
      the seating literally swings.</p>
    <p>00:00</p>
    <p>I think one of the great things of being an artist is that you, that you have the possibility to, come up with something else to, to come up with something new. And when you do so, you have to be careful because it's a huge responsibility.</p>
