      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>KRISTINE: we have a lot of fun doing what we're doing. I think in this context very, very serious about it. But especially with topics around sustainability, it can be so daunting. But we really love diving into these quite complicated
        projects and experimenting with materials and trying to find the delight and the surprise, and put ourselves in the shoes as a visitor. And we just try and bring that energy to projects.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>KRISTINE: I'm <a data-img="../assets/images/matthews/sm_section6_img3.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span id=“keyword”>Kristine Matthews</span></a> founder and director at Studio Matthews.</p>
      <p>NICOLE: I’m <a data-img="../assets/images/matthews/sm_section6_img2.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span id=“keyword”>Nicole Fischetti</span>, senior designer.</p>
      <p>IAN: <a data-img="../assets/images/matthews/sm_section6_img1.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span id=“keyword”>Ian Campbell</span></a>, senior designer.</p>
      <h3 id=“keyword”>MoPoP Signage</h3>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>KRISTINE: So for <a data-img="../assets/images/matthews/sm_section4_img1.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imghover"><span id=“keyword”>MoPop</span></a>, super complicated building -Thank you. Frank Gehry -for like three different entrances on two different levels. Once you're inside, there are no windows for orientation and it’s an incredibly
        disorienting building. So there was that challenge. It's also a super colorful building. We did a set of color tests to see what color would stand out in the environment the most and found that actually it's so colorful that the only colors
        that stand out are <a data-img="../assets/images/matthews/sm_section4_img2.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imghover"><span id=“keyword”>black and white</span></a>.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>NICOLE: Yeah, I think that's the best part of working with architects is that you let their, you know, what's hopefully a beautiful piece of architecture, inform our decisions in a way or inspire. So taking the existing design of the
        architecture or the landscape and responding to that.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>IAN: Yeah. So as designers, so I think that we’re somewhat obligated to have knowledge, I would say that current sustainable materials or sustainable practices, but beyond that, kind of to ingrain that into your process of thinking. So even
        from the very beginning, if you're thinking about a production methods or the life cycle of the design, you can oftentimes achieve much more than if it's just a materials based solution.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>KRISTINE: So we came up with the solution of <span id=“keyword”>steel bands</span> so that when one show change, they only had to change one, one band. The band's are two sided so they can use it, you know, twice and, and reuse it. And so it
        gave them a much more flexible and hopefully appropriate system that is more sustainable.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>NICOLE: The joy in figuring out what the problem is and how to solve it is why I design. And it seems to be a shared passion between all of us in the studio.</p>
