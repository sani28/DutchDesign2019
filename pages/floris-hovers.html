  <!-- DESIGNER TRANSCRIPT -->

  <section class="transcript">
    <div id="transcript-container">
      <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
      <p>00:00:10 </p>
      <p>I'm really not interested in future. It seems a little bit weird, of course, as a designer or artist, but I'm not believing in technology. I like it in some way. Of course I use it and we need it, but it's going too fast. And it's taking
        over more and more humanity. I want to work with my hands, to think about things I do and to react on the world.</p>
      <p>00:00:38</p>
      <p>I’m <a data-img="../assets/images/floris/floris_section2_img1.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>Floris Hovers</span></a>, I’m from the Netherlands and I'm a designer and artist and this is my space where I make things, found out things,
        try out
        things.</p>
      <p>00:00:53</p>
      <p>I was always outside or in the workshop of my father or the <a data-img="../assets/images/floris/floris_section1_img3.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>concrete factory</span></a> of my father. We were able to make things, to be curious
        to the
        world, and I think it's still one of the bases I work from. </p>
      <h3 id=“composedMaps”>Composed Maps</h3>
      <p>00:01:12</p>
      <p>Two years ago, I came in contact with Post Modern. I was already building cities and autonomous models. And they asked me to do something with that in the scale of the cards they work with. And I thought it must flat because it must be a
        postcard, but it’s no, <a data-img="../assets/images/floris/floris_section5_img2.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span id="keyword">it has to be 3D.</span></a></p>
      <p>00:01:35</p>
      <p>And I try to reduce it in a small scale. And I built it up with all different things I found on the street or in my desk, also the little pieces of scrap wood I have from my own production</p>
      <p>00:01:55</p>
      <p>Making these composed maps, little objects can get another meaning because you work in another dimension, the thing is also getting another dimension. </p>
      <p>00:02:06</p>
      <p>Sometimes, I finished a composed map and then I think it's not so very nice, but I'm not going to take it away and [I] just leave it because that's the reality. Because when you look in the world, there are a lot of place that are not nice
        and they are also important. </p>
      <h3 id=“keyword”>PlankFurniture</h3>
      <p>00:02:27</p>
      <p>I was searching to find out if it possible to limitate yourself by material and then making a furniture. So I took a, a plank, standardized plank. Then, I was finding out is it possible to make a chair of one plank?</p>
      <p>00:02;44</p>
      <p>And by searching in the limitation of the material you get <a data-img="../assets/images/floris/floris_section4_img1.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span id="keyword">this sort of moments here.</span></a> It's really was during the process that things are coming together.</p>
      <p>00:02:58</p>
      <p>In some way, you're going deeper in it than when everything is possible. And you find out new ways in the, in that limitation. And that's also why it's for me a very important way to keep the simplicity in designing your product.</p>
      <p>00:03:19</p>
      <p>You can design on a way that everything is perfect and well done and high ended and finished, but for me,I'm more interested in the human feeling in a product.</p>
      <p>00:03:40</p>
      <p>When you going to look to <a data-img="../assets/images/floris/floris_section4_img1.jpg" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span id="keyword">this chair</span></a> I made by myself and it's not perfect. And that's what we are. We are not perfect.</p>
