      <div id="transcript-container">
        <h3 id="intro">Process</h3>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: I think it comes down to process and for us, we, the process that we've learned for ourselves has, it's kind of formulated into something that allows us to tackle any kind of question in design.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: Yeah, and creativity is a big part of it. You know, and understanding your own creativity is also really important. And that's something that we've gotten to know as a result of doing a lot of different kinds of projects. Understanding that the process that we've built up can fit in making an art gallery product or making a product for IKEA or making a product for ourselves.</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: We’re Studio Truly Truly, I'm <a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>Kate Booy, this is Joel Booy</span></a>. We’re partners in life and in work. We run a design practice that specializes in creating all kinds of objects for the living environment.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: we also do installation work, which helps us to understand how those objects fit in an environment as well.</p>
        <p>KATE: Yeah. We're based here in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, but we’re originally from Australia.</p>
        <h3>Sofa For IKEA PS-2017</h3>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: Looking at a bigger space like a house or you know, an interior space that sparks certain, you know, considerations or questions about how we're using objects in the space, what kind of objects you might be putting together and then that, you know, influences what you might be doing on an object level.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: The brief was explore comforts or the living space. And so we're like, okay, what’s more comfortable than a cloud of cushions?</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: One thing we really wanted to do was to strip apart the idea of a sofa being made with MDF and glued on foam. And all these things where everything's all together and thrown out altogether. So that's why the <a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>Sofa is, it's just cushions</span></a>. And then the process of making it was, well, we don't have any experience with making a sofa anyways, so let's, let's try it out when, and that was to play with play with some, an idea that we had.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: Yeah. Manipulating the forms. We literally got the cushions in our hands and started playing with
        <p>JOEL: stapling them to lots of wood,</p>
        <p>KATE: and what can we create with this. Yes. It became a material that we were playing with.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: So the form of that cushion is created by the natural force, squeezing it in the middle and then it creates this beautiful plume sort of image. And we didn't, we didn't, we, it's a form by, by gravity, by tension, by you know. It's not by drawing it, it's by finding it.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL:  And really, the future of this was to design by doing, to learn, by doing, because the idea of upholstery, you know, like, do you know what's in there? You don't until you've done it until you've tried to do something that's wrong. So that's what that was all about.</p>
        <h3>Typography Lighting</h3>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: Rakumba an Australian lighting company, they approached us and we had a real discussion a conversation about lighting, where it was heading. And the question was, would it be possible to design a decorative track lighting system of sorts.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: Like typographies you've got all these <a data-img="https://via.placeholder.com/840x540.png" data-fx="1" id="imgHover"><span>different elements</span></a> that when you put them together, they have to look beautiful together, but they're all completely different. Like a ‘k’ looks different to a ‘u’, but somehow you have to put enough, tweaked uh little details in there that make it work. And, because then we can play with all these different things and it gives us a lot of anchor points.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: And this is something that we do a lot in our way of working, you know we always have kind of anchor points that help us to make it interesting to give it depth. So there's all these, there's all these details in typography that we knew deeply being typography designers, graphic designers.</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: it sort of ties into this anyway, the objects for the living space for the future that can be interpreted a little more abstractly so that they might be used in multiple ways, but it's not like a, a multi-use object where it's like a Swiss army knife and all the uses are really described. But more abstract pieces.</p>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>KATE: Communication is a big part of our design philosophy. We believe that anything that we create will communicate to an audience in one way or another, whether that's a chair or a piece of graphic design or an installation of a space. And so when we're choosing all the different features of this thing that we're making, we're thinking about that in our mind. Like, okay, what will this rough texture communicate? Well, what will that feel like? What's the overall composition of all these choices that we're making and how does that apply?</p>
        <p>00:00</p>
        <p>JOEL: It's all just about the right decisions. Every decision, every single one is, is it is what a designer what a designer is all about.</p>
        <p>KATE: And sometimes that's a decision to go back a few steps and start a little look again.</p>
