  <!-- DESIGNER TRANSCRIPT -->
<section class="transcript">
    <div id="transcript-container">
      <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>REBECCA: I'm Rebecca Geskus and I live on Texel, a beautiful island, and we have a studio. We like to use the local products, the local materials. And this is my husband, Jan.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>Hi, ich bin Jan Gremmen. We've worked together since seven years I think. And uh, she started and uh, well I, uh, joined her and I support her.</p>
      <p>00:00</p>
      <p>REBECCA: Haha. Yeah. Yeah. He's my second hand. My right hand.</p>
      <h3>Vegetarian Sheepskins</h3>
      <p>00:00</p>
      REBECCA: We put the vegetarian skin of fleece on the markets, and people who are vegetarian, they say, hey, whoa, I like animals very much, but I never can have a fleece because I don't want to have a killed sheep in my house. And so it's also
      a reason that they liked the skins.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: With the brown sheep, no one makes anything with it, they only want white wool and therefore the dark wool is very cheap. Yeah. But more and more expressive in, in, in, in colors.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: You are guarantee, there’s guarantee that it's a local product. Yeah. We don't ship the wool to China and the product comes again. Yeah. And the, and then it comes here and we make it.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: here this is the Texel wool. And the structure is not very, uh, effective with opening and closing. This is more strong. So we used the, the felting qualities of Merino wool to combine it with the texel wool.
      <p>00:00</p>
      REBECCA: I was thinking how can I make more strength, and when you put a fish net inside it's strong because of fishing net.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: Little bit like concrete. You put iron in it and you put fishnet in wool.
      <p>00:00</p>
      REBECCA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh, that was a new idea and I like to do more things with that idea. And, uh, it's a local and it's, it's also for free, the fishing net, you can take from the harbor because they throw it away.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: It's also because you like to, uh, to uh, work with, uh, useless things to, to give, uh, a new life or new worth.
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: I think that's just a, a little part of her qualities to see possibilities, just to go in it. I think that is also a quality to do what your heart tells and not, just uh, uh, look at the practical consequences at the first sight.
      <p>00:00</p>
      REBECCA: Yeah. There is a challenge when people ask something or, for film, for “can you make this” - and in my brain it’s tic tac tic tac. I'm build thinker… What is build thinker? I think in images
      it's also, you can make nice combinations for the normal, For somebody who's very structured, don't make that combinations I make. Maybe. I think, it's a positive thing.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: Of the chaos.
      <p>00:00</p>
      REBECCA: Of the chaos. Yeah yeah.
      <p>00:00</p>
      JAN: *both laugh* That’s a nice end to the interview now.
